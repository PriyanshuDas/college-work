-> Implementation (Algorithm was correct, implementation was messy)	(-)
		- Cleaner Implementation
		
-> Didn't read all problems	(**)
		- Better Reading
		
-> Didn't number pages					(-)
		- Number before contest
		
-> Didn't document algorithm before coding (relates to problem 1)
		- Get solution first
		- Write down the steps (clean and clear, but short)

-> Wrong interpration of the problem	(-)
		- Before implementation, know what the question asks
		- Write down the requirements
		
-> Didn't Discuss problems we could have solved by discussing
