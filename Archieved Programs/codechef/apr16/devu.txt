Problem : Devu and good strings (DEVGOSTR)

Constraints : 	T 	<= 	50
		A 	<= 	3
	       |s| 	<=	50
		K	<=	|s|

Observations :

-> 50 test cases, ie max instr per test case ~ 2*(10^6)
-> Total Permutations possible = (3^50) ~ (10^23) Not feasible
-> for a non-good string, the following property will hold :-
	- No three consecutive characters in the string are same
	- No three alternating characters in the string are same
	- Basically, there shouldn't be a specific gap, such that the same chara 		repeats after every gap more than 1ce

-> Simpler form of problem : How many good strings are there for length n, 3 char
