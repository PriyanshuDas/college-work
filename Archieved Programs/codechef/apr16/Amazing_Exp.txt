CodeChef April Challenge 2016

Problem Name : Amazing Experiment (AMAEXPER)

Problem : - 	Strategic val of node u : max(dist(u, v)) For all v in tree
		Strategic val of subtree u : min(stra(v)) for all v in subtree(u)
		Print Strategic value of each subtree

Observations :-
	-> Centroid Decomposition
	-> For every node, find and store distance to its ancestors in C-Tree
	-> For every node u, go to all it's ancestors x
	-> Find max(dist(u, x) + val[x][0] (if val[x] != dist(u,x) (else val[x][1])). Store this value.
	-> Do DFS of tree, for every node store the min val of their descendants


		Voila, This is the Answer!
